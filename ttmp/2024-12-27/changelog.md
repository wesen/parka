# HTMX Form Path Handling

Improved HTMX form URL handling by adding automatic redirect from paths without trailing slash to paths with trailing slash. This ensures consistent form submission paths and better URL organization.

- Moved redirect logic from serve.go to form.go for better code organization
- Added automatic redirect from /example-htmx to /example-htmx/ in FormHandler
- Ensures form submissions work correctly with proper URL paths
